# Build your own Kubernetes cluster at home

I took inspiration, and borrowed some code, from these sources:

https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way

https://medium.com/@art.vasilyev/use-ubuntu-cloud-image-with-kvm-1f28c19f82f8

**STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!**

Come back later, I expect this repo to be complete in a few days (?).
